# Syzygy

*/ˈsɪzɪdʒi/* - The conjunction or opposition of two corresponding things.

This tool seamlessly connects you to an AI chat agent, allowing you to multiply your productivity with rapid script-driven automation.

## Key Features

- **Progressive Abstraction**: What sets Syzygy (as a chat agent) apart is its ability to perform abstraction, allowing you to build up complexity one step at a time, before asking the AI to abstract it away into a function.
- **Deno-Powered**: Scripts executed by Syzygy can do anything Deno can, which includes executing more AI calls! Syzygy can write a script that selectively executes more AI prompts, e.g. for advanced mass code refactoring.
- **Fully sandboxed**: Deno provides powerful sandboxing features, allowing you to manually whitelist what the script can access. This gives you a lot more trust in Syzygy's arbitrary code execution.

## Perfect For

Syzygy shines the most when you're tasked with prototyping/developing one-off scripts. Use case examples include:
- One-off complex website scraper
- Performing large one-off repetitive code refactoring
- Transcoding a folder of complex media files with ffmpeg
- Performing complex one-off validation on data
- Generating a report on the status of a database/system

## Getting Started

*Syzygy will support standalone execution in the near future*

## Requirements

Syzygy requires Deno 2.0 or higher.

## Documentation
